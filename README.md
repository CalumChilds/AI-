# Computing Society AI Horoscope
Welcome to the code for our AI horoscope!

To get set up:
1. Download this repository (you can do that by ...)
2. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your laptop [put link in here].
3. Once you've installed Node.js, you should find a program called Node.js command prompt installed. Open it.
4. Unzip your repository file and make sure you know where it is located on your computer.
5. Using the `cd` command, navigate to where the horoscope code is stored. For example. if your code is stored in Downloads/Horoscope, you need to type `cd Downloads/Horoscope`.
6. Once you've done that, run the command `npm run dev`. It should be installing all the packages that our code needs to run.
7. Once that has been successfully completed, you should see an instruction telling you what URL your local project is being hosted it. Go to your web browser and navigate to it.
